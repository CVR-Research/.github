# Convexity & Volatility Research Group (CVR Reseach)
> Reading the economy through the options market.

Welcome to **CVR Research**. We study how option prices encode **economic information**—from implied funding costs and liquidity premia to policy expectations, tail risk, and cross-market stress. Our goal is to turn options-implied signals into transparent, reproducible **macro-micro insights**.

## What we work on

### Options & Term Structure
- Skew/term structure modeling
- Implied/realized relationships
- Regime detection

### Implied Funding & Box Rates
- Put–call parity and **box-implied funding** vs policy rates (Fed funds/OIS)
- Term and moneyness effects that reveal **balance-sheet tightness**

### Liquidity & Balance-Sheet Stress
- **Parity gaps**, deep borrow costs, and “specials” as indicators of **collateral scarcity**
- Execution slippage and inventory costs as **macro stress thermometers**

### Term Structure & Macro Regimes
- IV term structure, carry/roll, and slope/convexity as proxies for **growth/inflation risk pricing**
- Regime detection from realized vs implied divergence

### Tail Risk, Insurance Demand & Credit
- Skew, kurtosis, and jump risk as **insurance demand** and **default/left-tail** sentiment
- Mapping equity tails to credit-like signals

### Microstructure → Macro
- From trade/quote dynamics and assignment risk controls to **systemic-risk diagnostics**
